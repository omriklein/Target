 *** Target ***

 TODO List:
VX1. drag and  drop triangles *from slots*.
  2. create simple first models.
VX3. menu and levels --> use XML file for levels information.
  4. make the board change its scale according to the screen resolution.
  5. visualize the board...

 Stuff to remember:
  # currently it's 3d objects. maybe I will change it to 2d.
  # the ball and the triangles need to have the physics material "Bounce".
  # the ball sould Not be created inside the canon or else it will disappear.
  # the Target, the Walls and the Canon sould have the tags "Finish", "Wall" and "Respawn".
  # To Change the tiles size you need to change the TILE_SIZE in the "Triangle" script 
	and in the "GameManager" change the tile prefub (in the editor) 
	and in the function 'creadBoard' change the i++/j++ to i+=2/j+=2 (or something else).
